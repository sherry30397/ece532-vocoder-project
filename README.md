This project aims to create a voice encoder, or vocoder, using a Nexys Video Board. 
A voice input audio is collected using a microphone then imposed onto a carrier signal, and the resulting synthesized audio is output through earbuds. 
The audio input and output devices are connected to the boardâ€™s 3.5mm audio jacks. 
The carrier signal is selected by a 16-button keypad, which chooses between a set of preset waveforms generated by a digital synthesizer

The final project closely resembles the Nexys Video Audio DMA Demo available on the Diligent Reference Manual. 
The team attempted to implement some additional modules, including an audio processing module and additional PMOD interfaces for more audio playback options.
